# EducationalMalwareKit
Toolkit for creating educational malware in C# .NET. Started as academic project, aimed to assist in introductory malware reverse-engineering. 

## Getting started
**Using it**
1) You can download the latest (stable) version [here](https://github.com/IndexOverflow/educational-malwarekit/releases). 
2) Optional. Add the path to emk.exe to your path
3) Run emk.exe from the command line 

**Payloads**

SamplePayloads contains examples to show you how payloads can be implemented. Payloads can contain any logic as long as it's main entry class implements the exported Interface (`IEducationalMalwarePayload`).
To import a payload, simply copy 

## Creating your own payload
**Implementation of the interface**

1) Clone / download the repo to your computer. 
2) Locate the `IEducationalMalwarePayload` interface within the `EducationalMalware.Toolkit` project.
3) Create your own C# project (library type). Reference the `EducationalMalware.Toolkit` project.
4) Implement the interface in your payload.

**Interface methods**

The interface expects you to implement three methods.

 - `Run()`. Will be called upon execution of the payload. If you return from this method the malware will halt.
 - `OnHalt()`. If a kill signal is successfully intercepted, this method will be called. Allows 
 you to cleanup / remove traces.
 - `ValidateConfig(* PayloadConfiguration)` Called during the assembly process of the malware. Will be called with the configuration given from the user, allowing you to check that required values are expected. PayloadConfiguration is a sub-type of `Dictionary<string,string>`, allow you to access given config values in a familiar manner. If values are missing you can indicate this to the user by calling `SetInvalidOrMissingPair(string key, string value)` on the given `PayloadConfiguration` object.

**Preparing the payload**

1) Compile your payload into a assembly (.dll). Place the created the assembly, along with any additional libraries (assemblies) in a new folder. You can optionally also include a sample configuration file (see the included sample payload in the repo) and a icon file. 
2) Optional. Copy your folder into the PayloadLibrary folder created by emk.exe.
