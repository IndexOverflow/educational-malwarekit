# Why this project?
Copying payload files could also have been done with post-build  commands. However, this makes the
solution less portable and also introduces a lot of garbage in the payload, output lib. 
That said, a less convoluted method should be found.

# How-to
Create / Add your payload project in the solution folder (EducationalMalwareKit.Payloads). Develop the payload as normal.
Once the payload is complete, add a reference in this project (PayloadReference) to its core files (classes and manifest.json).
Thhis project will automatically copy any referenced files into the CLI project's output dir.
